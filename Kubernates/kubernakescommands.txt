mongo and express commands like docker

k8 managing and containerization of applications
orcheestration tool
like cloud
controlling which cloud or containers can be up or donw
use with microservices

kubecli or minikube
control panel => worker nodes
config => url for our application dburl => bd in internal location
secrets => id passwords, aws secret key etc

deployment => put the application on a pod or worker nodes
(mongo)
service => expose the ports and allow the appliation to be accessed by the group

during deployment => secrets and config are global sort of
nodePort => for people outside to interact with your web app
kube ctl => interact with control plane
0 down time
brew install kubectl
docker environment = > minikube 
brew install minikube

yaml or json => for creating secrets file

# Config file => non confidential all url and connection related stuff
secret file => Stuff related to password and username
 
container is the image => wrapped around with stuff to know how many replicas are possible

# Kubernates has 3 parts
1) service
2) config
3) secrets
4) Deployment
5) App.yaml
 

# Now for yaml
do this
create 3 yaml files
1) monogo-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
	name
and data will have the mongodb url

2) secret.yaml
write the 
apiVersion:v1
kind will be secret
metadata: includes the name and type(opaque)
data will be a key and value pair thing

3) mongo-app.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:name and labels
instead of data we have here is the spec which includes replicas, 
selector and matchlabels template and also specs for containers
like name, port number and env which has a reference
from secret.yaml and use the same key

4) in the app file has 2 parts the deployment and the service
 --- write the service file data
username, password, port, all from the service file variables and one 
from the config file 
selector is where ais the main app=> webapp or mongo
Node port to access outside our local host


minimkube is an enviornment

minikube start

kubectl get pod
kubectl apply -f mongo-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-app.yaml
kubectl apply -f web-app.yaml
kubectl get pod
kubectl get configmap
kubectl get secret
kubectl get svc
minikube ip
kubectl get node -o wide
minikube service webapp-service
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

kubectl delete deployment --all
kubectl delete secret --all

# Yaml
Serilaization language
certain protocol standards
django, mysql => oautho
mongo, nodejs => analytics of the project

# Networking in linux
https://blog.learncodeonline.in/networking-in-linux

# Devops
code available to the client

1) Linux=> namespaces etc
2) Github
3) Yaml
4) Cloud AWS, Azure, GCP
5) Docker
6) Kubernates makes you cloud independent
7) Ansible Circle CI 
8) Terraform (Infrastructure as a code)
